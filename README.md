# Resume-Screening - NLP

# Introduction:

In the digital age, the recruitment process has undergone a significant transformation, thanks to advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence. One such revolutionary application is in resume screening, where machine learning algorithms are utilized to automate and enhance the candidate selection process. In this post, we delve into an end-to-end project that leverages machine learning techniques to categorize resumes, provide job recommendations, and extract vital information seamlessly.

## DISCLAIMER ⚠️
> This is a POC(Proof of concept) kind-of project. The data used here comes up with no guarantee from the creator. So, don't use it for making decisions. If you do so, the creator is not responsible for anything. However, this project presents the idea that how we can use ML/NLP if developed at large scale and with authentic and verified data.

## How to use 💻
- Upload the Resume (PDF, TXT) and get the extracted information by clicking submit

## How to run locally 🛠️
- Before the following steps make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/download), [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed on your system
- Clone the complete project with or you can just download the code and unzip it
  ```
  ❯ git clone -b deploy https://github.com/bhoomikamittal8/resume_screening_NLP.git
  ```
- Once the project is cloned, open anaconda prompt in the directory where the project was cloned and paste the following block
  ```
  conda create -n resume_screening_NLP python=3.6.12
  conda activate resume_screening_NLP
  ```
only you have to activate it everytime you open new terminal or reopen project after exit.
- Activate venv (virtual environment)
    ```
    conda activate resume_screening_NLP
    ```
- And finally run the project with
  ```
  python app.py
  ```
- Open the localhost url provided after running `app.py` and now you can use the project locally in your web browser.
